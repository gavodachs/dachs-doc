Extra interpreted text roles for writing such documents:

* dachsdoc -- generates a link into the current DaCHS documentation.
  The argument is the relative path, e.g.,
  :dachsdoc:`opguide.html#userconfig-rd`.
* dachsref -- generates a link into the reference documentation.  The
  argument is a section header within the reference documentation, e.g.,
  :dachsref:`//epntap#populate-2_0` or :dachsref:`the form renderer`.
* samplerd -- generates a link to an RD used by the GAVO data center
  (exhibiting some feature).  The argument is the relative path to
  the RD (or, really, anything else in the VCS), e.g.,
  :samplerd:`ppmxl/q.rd`.

(if you add anything here, please also amend the
:dachsref:`ReStructedText` section in the references).

Please *do not* edit ref.rstx, it is generated (externally, using
dachs gendoc) from refdoc.rstx and the DaCHS source code.
