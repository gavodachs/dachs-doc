.. highlights:: While you do not have to write any HTML to publish
   data using DaCHS, and indeed we discourage spending much effort on
   fancy web pages – the VO is about generically usable APIs, not fancy,
   but non-interoperable web pages –, for some special effects or even
   the occasional custom UI many aspects of DaCHS web browser appearance
   can be overridden (and new behaviour introduced) through its
   nevow-based templating system.  This article discusses how to do
   that.

DaCHS's System Templates
========================

Overriding System Templates
---------------------------

DaCHS web pages are generated from templates delivered in the
distribution's ``gavo/resources/templates`` subdirectory.  Since that might
actually be in an "egg" (compressed archive) on your installation, the
easiest way to get at them is by using ``gavo admin dumpDF
templates/<template-name>``.  The main reason to get them is to override
them locally.  To do that, put the template into
``<dachs-root>/web/templates``.

For instance, if you wanted to change the sidebar, on a default
installation you would type::

  $ cd /var/gavo/web/templates
  $ gavo admin dumpDF templates/sidebar.html > sidebar.html

While changes to templates will (almost) always directly show up in the
pages served by DaCHS, if you freshly override a system template, you
will need to re-start the server to make it realise it should load the
template from a different source.

The content of the template files must be well-formed XML, preferably
valid XHTML plus some extra elements and attributes from the
``http://nevow.com/ns/nevow/0.1`` namespace, and DaCHS will throw errors
on non-well-formed XML.  You may want to use run XML validators – as in::

  xmlstarlet val -e sidebar.html

(requires the xmlstarlet package) – on the file before deploying them,
although DaCHS error messages should typically give you a useful
hint on where you got it wrong in case of errors.

While the sidebar's (and some other templates') source may not immediately
figure as HTML, you can simply start adding HTML.  Try, perhaps, adding::

  <p class="sidebaritem">Hello world.</p>

above the opening div in sidebar.html and reload a page showing the
sidebar.  Your new material should show in the page.

Note that, if you override a template, it is a good idea to evaluate
changes in the upstream templates after updating DaCHS.
You can do this by
running::

  svn log https://svn.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/svn/gavo/python/trunk/gavo/resources/templates

(perhaps narrowing it down to the file you overrode).  We try to avoid
breaking user templates, but as there's no regression testing against
that in place, and sometimes templates might reference functionality
that has been dropped. So, it may and therefore will still happen
(which is an important reason for trying to avoid overriding system
templates and asking on dachs-support if someone knows another way to
achive some desired effect. Plus, of course, by
following upstream changes you can follow improvements we make – the
popular "Send via SAMP" functionality, for instance, required a template
change.

Templates Commonly Used
-----------------------

Ignoring some templates used for administration and internal purposes,
here is a list of templates used by DaCHS:

:defaultresponse.html:
  used by the form renderer for both the form
  itself and the result page.  This is what you want to start from when
  doing custom UIs.
:examples.html:
  used to format DALI examples (see `Writing
  Examples`_)
:loginout.html:
  used when logging out; note that DaCHS uses HTTP
  basic authentication; so, this is not a page you can use to explain to
  your users what to do to log in, they'll just see the browser's
  authentication window.
:maintenance.html:
  used when the service is taken offline by creating
  a ``state/MAINT`` file.  The ``mainText`` data item contains the
  contents of that file
:rdinfo.html:
  the ``...browse/<rdId>`` pages are generated from these
:root-tree.html:
  see `The Root Template`_
:root.html:
  see `The Root Template`_
:serviceinfo.html:
  used by the info renderer
:sidebar.html:
  used by several browser-oriented renderers to create
  the sidebar
:tableinfo.html:
  used by the tableinfo renderer (which is what makes
  the ``tableinfo/<table name>`` pages)

The Root Template
-----------------

The ``root.html`` template is what is rendered when users request the
root resource of your DaCHS installation, so it is a fairly good target
for changing (and it's also fairly safe to override).
While you could put any well-formed XHTML there, we
recommend you base your template on either the distributed
``root.html``, which mainly gives a list of all services
available on the system, or ``root-tree.html``, which organizes services
in trees and only downloads metadata as necessary (a simple
non-javascript fallback is part of the distributed template, too).  The
latter is intended for use on sites that have more then a few tens of
services, when the plain ``root.html`` would expand to several 100s of
kilobytes.

You would again do this by going to ``/var/gavo/web/templates`` and
saying::

  gavo admin dumpDF templates/root.html > root.html

(change the first ``root.html`` to ``root-tree.html`` for the fancier
root page).  Then edit root.html.

Note that the root page (and a few more similarly static documents) are
fairly aggressively cached by DaCHS.  This means that changes to the
docment will not usually become immediately visible in your browser.
To force DaCHS to reload fixed templates, add a ``nocache`` argument
like this::

  http://localhost:8080?nocache=True

If you're happy with your design, run ``gavo serve expire //services``
(the root page cache is controlled by the //services RD), and it will be
shown to non-logged users, too.  That will only work when you have set
an adminpasswd (cf. :dachsdoc:`tutorial.html#the-admin-password`) –
otherwise, just restart the server.


The Templating Language
=======================

DaCHS employs nevow's stan as its templating language.  Our upstream,
the Twisted community, has since integrated it into its web2 framework;
since for DaCHS there is no compelling reason to migrate (but a fairly
compelling reason not to, since we want to avoid unnecessarily breaking
templates), we will keep nevow for the time being.

The great thing about nevow is that the templates are valid, verifyable
XHTML.  This is because nevow just adds a few elements and attributes in
a separate namespace.  This must be declared alongside the XHTML
namespace; a standalone template will thus have to start like this::

  <html
    xmlns:n="http://nevow.com/ns/nevow/0.1"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

(prepending this with a doctype declaration like::

  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

is optional [#dtd]_); in the following, we assume the ``n`` prefix for
the nevow namespace throughout, and you'd be devious to use something
else.

The nevow namespace contains the following names (examples below;
you're not supposed to understand things here, this is just a reference):

* ``n:invisible`` – an element that doesn't appear in the output.
  this is useful when you need some render or data attribute but have
  no element to "hang it on".
* ``n:attr`` – an element to add computed attributes to the embedding
  element.  If you know ``xsl.attribute``: same thing.
* ``n:slot`` – an element replacing itself with the value a mapping
  in the context data has for its ``name`` attribute.
* ``n:render`` – a universal (i.e., can go on any HTML tag) attribute
  changing the way the DOM tree is built below that element.  To avoid
  confusion with DaCHS renderers, we will call the values of these
  attributes "nevow renderers" in the following.
* ``n:pattern`` – a universal attribute a bit like a tree-typed
  argument to a nevow renderer
* ``n:data`` – a universal attribute pulling a piece of data from
  python into the rendering context for use by nevow renderers.

-- that's really all it takes for a powerful XML templating language.

In-Python Stan
--------------

While it's normally preferable to load templates from XML file,
sometimes you want to inline HTML fragments.  Stan makes that relatively
easy and save by providing a simple and elegant DOM-like language.
Essentially, one says::

  from nevow import tags as T

and then has the usual HTML elements as names within T.  Calling them
as functions will add attributes, indexing them will add  children.
This may sound odd but allows relatively nice expressions such as::

  T.body[
    T.p["See also ", T.a(href="http://example.com")["here"], ". or"],
    T.ul[[
      T.li["or ", T.a(href=link)[anchor]
        for link, anchor in linklist]]]]

This T is already in the namespace of the renderer function (see below).

More information and this (as well as the whole template language) is
available in `Meet Stan <http://docs.g-vo.org/meetstan.html>`_.



Template Language Example
-------------------------

To see how this works, consider the ``serviceinfo.html`` template (see
`Overriding System Templates`_ to see how to get it).  The first two "magic"
thing are children of ``head``::

  <title n:render="title"/>
  ...
  <n:invisible n:render="commonhead"/>

The first is an empty title saying it wants to be rendered by ``title``.
That is a DaCHS-defined nevow renderer that says "put the service title
as a text child of the embedding element (and delete any previous
child)".  If you are curious, the code implementing that is in
``metarender.ServiceInfoRenderer`` and looks like this::

  def render_title(self, ctx, data):
    return ctx.tag["Information on Service '%s'"%
      base.getMetaText(self.service, "title")]

Below is a list of the more `Common Render and Data Functions`_.

The other magic thing is the ``n:invisible``.  As said above, that tag
doesn't turn up in the result DOM, it's just there so we can call the
``commonhead`` nevow renderer.  It pulls in all the common CSS and
javascript declarations all (or most) DaCHS HTML pages want.

So: Nevow renderers essentially are just python functions putting things
into tags.

The next magic thing is::

  <body n:render="withsidebar">

Again, this is asks to pull in a whole lot of elements, this time from a
template (you probably guessed that it is ``sidebar.html``), except that
this renderer does not discard children present in the template but adds
them in a ``div``.  Perhaps the implementation
helps here (don't sweat the details at this point; the code is in
web.grend.GavoRenderMixin)::


  def render_withsidebar(self, ctx, data):
    oldChildren = ctx.tag.children
    ctx.tag.children = []
    return ctx.tag(class_="container")[
      self._sidebar,
      T.div(id="body")[
        T.a(name="body"),
        oldChildren
      ]]

(where ``self._sidebar`` contains a parse of the sidebar template).

Going on, you'll see::

  <div class="useservice" n:data="browserURL" n:render="ifdata">

This is the first example for ``n:data``.  What happens here is that I
put a thing into the render context, the ``browserURL``.  Again, that's
mapped to a python function, which again comes from
``web.metarender.ServiceInfoRenderer``.  It looks like this::

  def data_browserURL(self, ctx, data):
    return self.service.getBrowserURL()

– where the method returns a URL suitable for a web browser, or ``None``
if the service doesn't have a renderer for which a browser will display
something useful (e.g., a service only having an ``ssap.xml`` renderer).
This last part is used in the ``n:render="ifdata"``.  This nevow
renderer (if you're curious, it's in web.grend and thus available on all
DaCHS renderers) will return an empty string if the context object
evaluates to false, while otherwise returning the tree below it.

The net effect of this construct is that the "Use this service in your
browser" button that is generated in what's below will only be shown if
the service actualy is usable in a web browser.

The image is put in literally, but the link it points to has to be taken
from the context object (the ``browserURL``).  To get it into the
attribute, nevow uses a trick you may know from XSLT::

  <a>
    <n:attr name="href" n:render="string"/>
    <img src="/static/img/usesvcbutton.png" class="silentlink"
      alt="[Use this service from your browser]"/>
  </a>

Essentially, there's an element, ``n:attr``, that, when rendered, will
end up as an attribute on the embedding element (the ``a``).  The name
of that attribute is taken from the ``name`` attribute of ``n:attr``,
i.e., ``href`` in this case.  The value of that attribute can be
rendered in an arbitrary way, but in this case, I'm just using the
``string`` renderer (provided by nevow itself), which takes the context
object, stringifies it and dumps it into the DOM tree.  Had I written::

  <a>
    <n:attr name="href">http://foo.bar/baz</n:attr>
    a link
  </a>

the result would have been::

  <a href="http://foo.bar/baz">a link</a>

– while introducing constants in this way doesn't
make much sense, it might be useful if, for
instance, the context object were a relative link, in which case you
could have written::

  <a>
    <n:attr name="href">http://foo.bar/baz<n:invisible
      n:render="string"/></n:attr>
    a link
  </a>

If this seems spooky to you, play around with it for a moment – it's
really not as hard as it might seem.

What follows in ``serviceinfo.html`` is just more of the same, with some
additional nevow renderers explained below.  The next new thing – and
the last major concept to understand for nevew renderering – is
this::

  <ul n:data="rendAvail" n:render="sequence">
    <li n:render="mapping" n:pattern="item">
      <em><n:slot name="rendName"/></em> --
        <n:slot name="rendExpl"/></li>
  </ul>

Let's take this step by step.  First, we put something into the context
object: ``rendAvail``.  This is again taken from the DaCHS renderer
(still the ``ServiceInfoRenderer``), which reads::

  def data_rendAvail(self, ctx, data):
    return [{"rendName": rend,
        "rendExpl": RendExplainer.explain(rend, self.service)}
      for rend in self.service.allowed]

``RendExplainer.explain`` is a function returning DOM fragments
explaining what a renderer does, with embedded links and similar as
necessary.  So, what comes back is a structure looking like this::

  [
    {"rendName": "form", "rendExpl": "This is browseable"},
    {"rendName": "scs.xml", "rendExpl": "This is not browseable"}]

-- a sequence of mappings.

Such sequences you can renderer using the nevow-provided ``sequence``
nevow renderer.  This renderer looks for an element that has
``n:pattern="sequence"`` in the DOM tree below it, and renders one copy of
of that each for each element of the context object (which must be a
sequence) with, and that's the brilliant part, the context object set to
that object.  You may want to read that sentence again...

So, with example sequene above the::

  <li n:render="mapping" n:pattern="item">
    <em><n:slot name="rendName"/></em> --
      <n:slot name="rendExpl"/></li>

in the body of the ``ul`` element will be rendered twice, first with::

    {"rendName": "form", "rendExpl": "This is browseable"}

as the context object and then with::

    {"rendName": "scs.xml", "rendExpl": "This is not browseable"}]

These are mappings in python lingo, and so it may not surprise you that
to make something sensible of that, nevow provides a ``mapping`` nevow
renderer.  It's a bit like ``sequence`` in that it inspects the tree
below it.  Unlike it, it doesn't look for ``item`` patterns but for
``n:slot``, which has a ``name`` attribute – the element is then
replaced by the value of the named key in the mapping.

One last new thing is a bit further down::

  <n:invisible n:render="ifmeta rights">
    <h2>Copyright, License, Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p n:render="metahtml">rights</p>
  </n:invisible>

Here, the render attribute contains a blank.  Nevow interprets that as a
parameterised renderer; in effect, the parameter(s) are passed to the
renderer.  It probably helps to see how this is implemented::

  def render_ifmeta(self, metaName):
    if self.getMeta(metaName) is not None:
      return lambda ctx, data: ctx.tag
    else:
      return lambda ctx, data: ""

Anyway, parameterised nevow renderers need this extra argument, and
you'll get weird errors if you don't provide it.

And that's almost all you need to know about nevow's templating
language, except for what additional render and data functions there
are.  The more useful of which are covered in the next chapter.


Common Render and Data Functions
--------------------------------

In DaCHS templates, nevow renderers can come from nevow itself, the
active renderer (that's usually ``form`` for templates or a variety
thereof), or the active service element in the RD (``customRF`` and
``customDF`` for nevow renderers and data functions).  Unfortunately,
we've added nevow renderers and data functions in a somewhat ad-hoc
fashion, and so they're not really documented terribly well.

Until we get to imporve that, here's an overview of the nevow renderers
(and data functions) we believe are most useful in practice.

:string:
  (from nevow) takes the unicode of a context object and places that in
  the DOM

:sequence:
  (from nevow) iterates over the context object, rendering ``item``
  patterns in its subtree once per item.

:mapping:
  (from nevow) fills ``n:slot`` elements in its subtree with values from
  its (dict) context object, taking the slot's name attributes as keys

:meta (data function):
  (from GavoRenderMixin) puts the named item from the current meta
  parent (usually, the service) into the context object.  This could
  look like this::

    <p n:data="meta creationDate" n:render="ifdata">
      <n:span class="date" n:render="string"/></p>

  (you don't usally need this, prefer the meta render function)

:meta:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) renders the meta item named in the text content
  as text.

:metahtml:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) renders the meta item named in the text content
  as HTML; this automatically handles meta sequences and several special
  cases, so it's the preferred way of including metadata in templates.

:rootlink:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) this was intended for running DaCHS "off-root"
  (i.e., as if in a subdirectory of the server).  Since that's not how
  DaCHS was deployed in practice, it's not used consistently, so there's
  no point in using it right now.

:getconfig:
  (from  GavoRenderMixin) takes a config key from its content and
  renders it as the value of this configuration item, e.g.::

    Finish up in
    <span n:render="getconfig">[async]defaultExecTime</span> seconds

  If you leave out the section, [general] is assumed as usual.

:ifmeta:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) a parameterised renderer, i.e. used like
  this::

    <p n:render="ifmeta coverage"><stuff/></p>

  With this, stuff is rendered if a coverage meta item is present in the
  service.

:ifownmeta:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) like ifmeta, except meta items are not
  inherited (e.g., title, which service typically gets from the
  embedding resource)

:ifdata:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) only renders the embedded subtree if the
  context object evaluates to True

:ifnodata:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) only renders the embedded subtree if the
  context object evaluates to False

:ifslot:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) a parameterised renderer.  It only renders the
  embedded subtree (usually a slot) if the named key exists in the
  context object (which must be a dict-like thing)

:ifnoslot:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) the reverse of ifslot.

:ifadmin:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) renders the embedded subtree if there is a
  logged user and that user is gavoadmin.

:explodableMeta:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) used in the sidebar – see there for what it
  does.

:authinfo:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) returns material letting an anonymous user log
  in or a logged in user log out.

:prependsite:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) for templates intended to be shared between
  sites, this prepends the current site's short name (config item
  [web]sitename) to the element content.

:withsidebar:
  (from GavoRenderMixin) used on the ``body`` element, adds the standard
  DaCHS sidebar to a page.

:resulttable:
  (from HTMLResultRenderMixin) renders an HTML table out of a ``result``
  context object (this is what draws the table on default HTML results)

:resultline:
  (from HTMLResultRenderMixin) renders the first line of the result
  table in a key-value manner (this is sometimes used with the qp
  renderer)

:parpair:
  (from HTMLResultRenderMixin) expects a (key, value) pair in the
  context and renders it as key:value in the current tag (this is used
  to render the current parameters; to avoid showing lots of
  non-informative lines, this will render nothing if value is None.

:ifresult:
  (from HTMLResultRenderMixin) swallows the child tree if no result is
  available

:ifnoresult:
  (from HTMLResultRenderMixin) renders its content only if a result
  table is available but contains no rows.

:result:
  (from HTMLResultRenderMixin) a data function putting the current
  result into the context.  If no result is available (e.g., because no
  query has been sent), ``None`` will be put into the context data.

:queryseq:
  (from HTMLResultRenderMixin) a data function putting a sequence of
  (key, value) query parameters into the context data.

:param:
  (from HTMLResultRenderMixin) a parameterised renderer that takes a
  python format string and formats the value of the param named in the
  content with it, for instance::

    <span n:render="param %5.2f">rv</span>

:resultmeta:
  (from service.SvcResult) a data function on results (i.e., this
  must be in an element with ``n:data="result"``) putting a dictionary
  with at least the key ``itemsMatched`` into the context.

:inputRec:
  (from service.SvcResult) a data function on results (i.e., this
  must be in an element with ``n:data="result"``) putting a the
  parameters dictionary of the inputs table (typcially, the input
  parameters) into the context.

:table:
  (from service.SvcResult) a data function on results (i.e., this
  must be in an element with ``n:data="result"``) putting a the
  result's primary table into the context


Overriding the Default Response Template
========================================

Sometimes you want to change something in the appearance of a service
that cannot be done with either service/@customCSS or the tricks
described in `How do I add an image to a query form?`_.  You will then
need to override the defaultresponse template.  As an example, you can
refer to `apfs/res/apfs_new RD`_; it has a custom template sitting next to
the RD as ``response.template``, which is declared as a custom service
template in the service element via::

  <template key="response">res/response.template</template>

(the path is relative to the RD's resdir).

What we wanted to do here is change then title depending on input
parameters (sometimes it's "apparent places", sometimes "intermediate
places", and I also wanted to have a warning if users chose a non-single
star for the ephemeris generated, as that is probably inaccurate.

A word of warning: Do not introduce a custom template lightly.  We do
change ``defaultresponse.html`` occasionally, and you should probably
follow these changes in your templates.  So, before you do a custom,
service-specific template, ask on the dachs-support mailing list if
someone knows a smarter solution to your problem.

In the APFS case, what made us use a custom template is teh varying
title; that's really hard to do in some other way because the title is
service metadata, and the service is persistent within DaCHS, possibly
even used concurrently by concurrent requests.  Manipulating its
metadata per-request is therefore a bad idea.

So, what did we do?  First, get the default response template to have
something to start with.  We recommend to put it into a subdirectory
``/res``, so assuming you are in the RD's resdir, you'd do::

  $ mkdir -p res
  $ gavo admin dumpDF templates/defaultresponse.html > res/response.html

That done, you can place the template declaration above into the service
definition and start changing the template.  Changes should be
immediately visible on reload.

To give you an impression of the interplay between the template and the
RD, here is a closer look at the `apfs/res/apfs_new RD`_ and the
associated template at
https://svn.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/svn/gavo/hdinputs/apfs/res/response.html
There, we first had to add a custom render function rendering the title
to the service::

  <customRF name="apfsTitle">
    # wants n:data="result"
    if data.queryMeta.get("columnSet")==set(["equ"]):
      denom = "Apparent Places"
    elif data.queryMeta.get("columnSet")==set(["equ", "cio"]):
      denom = "Apparent and Intermediate Places"
    else:
      denom = "Intermediate Places"
    star = str(data.inputTable.getMeta("forStar"))
    return ctx.tag[denom+" for star \catname "+star]
  </customRF>

We're getting a parameter from ``queryMeta`` here, an ugly piece of
misdesign keeping lots of information on the request.  Before you repeat
that stunt, ask on dachs-support, because there are most certainly
better ways do do that.  The remaining part is a fairly straightforward
nevow renderer, perhaps except for the call of the catname macro, which
is here because in this particular case the render function is used by
two services and we've put it into a STREAM to allow reuse.

In comparison, the necessary changes in ``response.template`` are
minor::

      <h1 n:render="apfsTitle"/>

is all that's needed.  The template goes on saying::

  <p n:data="inputRec" n:render="mapping">
    ICRS position is &alpha;=<n:slot name="alpha"/>,
    &delta;=<n:slot name="delta"/>.
  </p>

This displays the position of the star for which the ephemeris is
computed for.  We do this here because the input to this service is
something like a catalog number, and alpha and delta are actually
computed by the service's input data descriptor.

Finally, when the result is in context, we do::

  <p style="border:2px solid red; max-width:400px; padding:5pt"
    n:render="multiplicityWarning"/>

We would do this today by attaching a ``_warning`` meta item on the
result, but since that was not available when we wrote the RD, we added
a custom render function like this::

  <customRF name="multiplicityWarning">
    # wants n:data="result"
    if data.inputTable.getMeta("multiple"):
      return ctx.tag["Warning:  This star"
        " is identified by Hipparcos as being a ",
        T.strong["multiple star."],
        " This means that proper motions given in the Hipparcos"
        " catalogue are unreliable when applied to extended periods"
        " of time.  Thus, the places given below will be severely"
        " wrong unless the orbital period of the object is sufficiently"
        " long (i.e., hundreds of years)."]
    return ""
  </customRF>

The ``multiple`` meta is put to the table further up in the computation.
Note how we leave as much as possible to the template; for instance, the
style is set there rather in the render function.


Custom Template, Custom Core
============================

For exotic, custom services you can combine a custom template with a
python (or custom) core.  Here is a stripped-down example to get you
started; if you want to run this, you will have to install pyephem
(if you port this to astropy and share your port with us, you'll receive
good Karma).

First, the RD; the thing to watch out for is the creation of the output
table, getting the input params, and setting the output params.  Note
that you'd normally generate table rows, which would be dicts added
through addRow::

  <resource schema="neptune">
    <!-- Metadata omitted.  Thou shalt not do this. -->
    <service id="s">
      <template key="response">response.html</template>
      <pythonCore>
        <inputTable>
          <inputKey name="for_date" type="timestamp"
            tablehead="Date"
            description="Date to compute ephemeris for">
            <property key="defaultForForm">1969-06-04</property>
          </inputKey>
          <inputKey name="lat" unit="deg" tablehead="Latitude">
            <property key="defaultForForm">49.4294</property>
          </inputKey>
          <inputKey name="long" unit="deg" tablehead="Longitude">
            <property key="defaultForForm">11.00417</property>
          </inputKey>
        </inputTable>

        <outputTable>
          <param name="next_rising" type="timestamp"/>
          <param name="next_setting" type="timestamp"/>
        </outputTable>

        <coreProc>
          <setup>
            <code>
              import ephem
            </code>
          </setup>
          <code>
            res = rsc.TableForDef(self.outputTable)
            n = ephem.Neptune(inputTable.getParam("for_date"))
            obs = ephem.Observer()
            obs.lat = inputTable.getParam("lat")*DEG
            obs.long = inputTable.getParam("long")*DEG
            obs.date = inputTable.getParam("for_date")
            res.setParam("next_rising", obs.next_rising(n).datetime())
            res.setParam("next_setting", obs.next_setting(n).datetime())
            return res
          </code>
        </coreProc>
      </pythonCore>
    </service>
  </resource>

And here's the template::

  <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
                  xmlns:n="http://nevow.com/ns/nevow/0.1">
  <head n:render="commonhead">
  <title>Nepune rising (and setting)</title>
  <style type="text/css">
    .horizontime {
      font-size: 300%;
      color: #ff6688;
      font-family: fantasy;
      white-space: nowrap;
    }
  </style>
  </head>
  <body n:data="result">
    <p style="text-align:center">
      Neptune rising:
        <span class="horizontime" n:render="param %s">next_rising</span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">
      Neptune setting:
        <span class="horizontime" n:render="param %s">next_setting</span>
    </p>
    <n:invisible n:render="form genForm"/>
  </body>
  </html>

Suggested exercise: write two renderers such that you can write::

  <span class="horizontime" n:render="rising_time"/>

and get the rising time formatted the way you want it.  If you get
stuck, ask back, and we'll provide a solution and a new exercise.

.. [#dtd] One reason *not* to declare a DTD is that careless clients
   other than web browsers (on system with misconfigured system
   catalogs) might stumble across such a page and try do download the
   DTD; the W3C was so pissed with clients doing that that they are now
   severely slowing them down by delaying delivery of the DTDs, which
   sometimes leads to surprising client behaviour.
