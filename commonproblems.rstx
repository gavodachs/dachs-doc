This document tries to discuss some error messages you might encounter
while running DaCHS.  The rough idea is that when you can grep in this
file and get some deeper insight as to what happened and how to fix
it.

We freely admit that some error messages DaCHS spits out are not too
helpful.  Therefore, you're welcome to complain to the authors whenever
you don't understand something DaCHS said.  Of course, we're grateful if
you checked this file first.


DistributionNotFound
====================

When trying to run any program, you may see tracebacks like::

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/usr/local/bin/gavo", line 5, in <module>
      from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
    [...]
    File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 552, in resolve
      raise DistributionNotFound(req)
  pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: gavodachs==0.6.3

This is usually due to updates to the source code when you have
installed your source in development mode.  Simple do ``sudo python
setup.py develop`` in the root of the source distribution again.

Another source of this error can be unreadable source directories.
Please check that the user that's trying to execute the command can
actually read the sources you checked out.


'gavodachs' package upgrade fails
=================================

If you try to upgrade an older version (< 0.9) of the 'gavodachs'
package, e.g. by typing::

  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

it could happen that you run into troubles when the gavodachs server is
going to be stopped (and restarted). If the server stop fails, the
installation of the 'gavodachs-server' package will aborted which leaves
the package in a half-configured state. The corresponding error message
would be something similar to::

  Stopping VO server: dachsTraceback (most recent call last):
    [...]
    File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 584,
      in resolve raise DistributionNotFound(req)
  pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: gavodachs==0.9

In that case try::

  sudo dpkg --remove --force-all python-gavodachs
  sudo apt-get -f install gavodachs-server

With these commands you should end up in the state obtained by a
successful package upgrade.


ignoreOn in a rowmaker doesn't seem to work
===========================================

The most likely reason is that you are testing for the presence of a key
that is within the table.  This will not work since rowmakers add
key->None mapping for all keys missing but metioned in a map (also
implicitely via ``idmaps``.

If more than one rowmake operate on a source, things get really messy
since rowmakers *change* the row dictionaries in place.  Maybe this
should change at some point, but right now that's the way it is.  Thus,
you can *never* reliably expect keys used by other tables to be present
or absent since you cannot predict the order in which the various
table's rowmakers will run.

To fix this, you can check against that key's value being NULL, e.g.,
like this::

  <keyIs key="accessURL" value="__NULL__"/>

You could also instruct the rowmaker to ignore that key; this would
require you to enumerate all rows you want mapped.


Import fails with "Column xy missing" and very few keys
=======================================================

This error is caused by the row validation of the table ingestor – it
wants to see values for all table columns, and it's missing one or more.
This may be flabbergasting when your grammar yields the fields that 
are missing here.  The reason is simple: You must map them in the
rowmaker.  If you see this error, you probably wanted to write
``idmaps="*"`` or something like that in the rowmaker.


Server is Only Visible from the Local Host
==========================================

When the server is running (``gavo serve start``) and you can access
pages from the machine the server runs on just fine, but no other
machines can access the server, you run the server with the default web
configuration.  It tells the server to only bind to the loopback
interface (127.0.0.1, a.k.a. localhost).

To fix this, say::

  [web]
  bindAddress:

in your /etc/gavo.rc.


Transaction Deadlocking
=======================

When gavo imp (or possibly requests to the server) just hangs without
consuming CPU but not doing anything useful, it is quite likely that you
managed to provoke a deadlock.  This happens when you have a database
transaction going on a table while trying to access it from the outside.

To give an example::

  from gavo import base
  from gavo import rsc
  t = rsc.TableForDef(tableDefForFoo)
  q = base.SimpleQuerier().query("select * from foo")

This will deadlock if tableDefForFoo actually defines an onDisk table foo.
The reason is that instanciating a database table object will create a
connection and start a transaction (e.g., to see if the table is
actually present on disk).

SimpleQuerier, on the other hand, creates another connection and another
transaction.  In general, the result of this second transaction will
depend on the outcome of the first one.  Postgres will notice that and
postpone creating the result until the t's transaction if finished.
That will never happen with this code.

To diagnose what's happening, it is useful to see the server's idea of
what is going on inside itself.  The following script (that you might
call psdb) will help you::

  #!/bin/sh
  psql gavo << EOF
  select procpid, usename, current_query, date_trunc('seconds', query_start::time)
  from pg_stat_activity
  order by procpid
  EOF

(this assumes your database is called gavo and you have sufficient
rights on that database; it's not hard to figure out the psql command
line for other scenarios).  This could output something like::

   procpid |  usename  |    current_query        | date_trunc 
  ---------+-----------+-------------------------+------------
      9301 | gavoadmin | <IDLE>                  | 16:55:39
      9302 | gavoadmin | <IDLE> in transaction   | 16:55:39
      9303 | gavoadmin | <IDLE> in transaction   | 16:55:39
      9306 | gavoadmin | <IDLE> in transaction   | 16:55:43
      9309 | gavoadmin | SELECT calPar FROM l... | 16:55:43
  (5 Zeilen)

The procpid is the pid of the process handling the connection.  Usually,
you will see one running query and possibly quite a few connections that
are idle in transaction (which are tables waiting to be fed, etc.).

The query should give you some idea where the deadlock occurs.  To
escape the deadlock (which, under CPython, will block ^C as well), kill
the process trying the query -- this will give you a traceback to the
offending instruction.  Of course, you will need to become the
postgres or root user to do that, so it may be easier to forego the
traceback and just kill gavo imp.

To fix such a situation, there are various options.  You could commit
the table's transaction::

  from gavo import base
  from gavo import rsc
  t = rsc.TableForDef(tableDefForFoo)
  t.commit()
  q = base.SimpleQuerier().query("select * from foo")

but that is not usally what you want to do.  Much more often, you want
to execute the second query in t's transaction.  In this case, this
could work like this::

  from gavo import base
  from gavo import rsc
  t = rsc.TableForDef(tableDefForFoo)
  q = base.SimpleQuerier(connection=t.connection).query("select * from foo")

Of course, it is not always easy to access the connection object.  Note,
however, that in most procedure definitions, you have the target data
set available as data.  If you have that, you can usually obtain the current
connection (and thus transaction) via::

  data.getPrimaryTable().connection

-- at least if you designate one of the data's tables as primary through
its make elements.



'prodtblAccref' not found in a mapping
======================================

You get this error message when you make a table that mixes in
//products#table (possibly indirectly, e.g., via SSAP or SIAP mixins)
with a grammar that does not use the //products#define row filter.

So, within the grammar, say (at least, see the reference documentation
for other parameters for rowgen)::

  <rowfilter procDef="//products#define">
    <bind name="table">\schema.table</bind>
  </rowfilter>

-- substituting dest.table with the actual name of the table fed.  The
reason why you need to manually give the table is that the grammar
doesn't now what table the rows generated end up in.  On the other hand,
the information needs to be added in the grammar, since it is fed both
to your table and the system-wide products table.


I get "Column ssa_dstitle missing" when importing SSA tables
============================================================

The ``//ssap#setMeta`` rowmaker application does not directly fill the
output rowdict but rather defines new input symbols.  This is done to
give you a chance to map things set by it, but it means that you must
idmap at least all ssa symbols (or map them manually, but that's
probably too tedious).  So, in the rowmaker definition, you write::

  <rowmaker idmaps="ssa_*">


"unpack requires a string argument of length"
=============================================

These typically come from a binary grammar parsing from a source with
armor=fortran.  Then, the input parser delivers data in parcels given
by the input file, and the grammar tries to parse it into the
fields given in your binaryRecordDef.  The error message means that
the two don't match.

This can be because the input file is damaged, you forgot to skip
some header, but it can also be because you forgot fields or your
binaryRecordDef doesn't match the input in some other way.


"resource directory '<whatever>' does not exist"
================================================

DaCHS expects each RD to have a "resource directory" that contains
input files, auxillary data, etc.  Multiple RDs may share a single
resource directory.  

By default, the resource directory is <inputsDir>/<schema>. If you don't
need any auxillary files, the resdir doesn't need to exist. In that
case, you'll see the said warning.  To suppress it, you could just say::

  <resource schema="<whatever>" resdir="__system">

The ``__system`` resource directory is used by the built-in RDs and thus
should in general exist.

However, the recommended layout is, below ``inputsDir``, a subdirectory
named like the resource schema, and the RD immediately within that
subdirectory.  In that case, you don't need a resdir attribute.


Only RDs from below inputsDir may be imported
=============================================

RDs in DaCHS must reside below ``inputsDir`` (to figure out what that is
on your installation, say ``gavo config inputsDir``).  The main reason
for that restriction is that RDs have identifiers, and these are
essentially the inputsDir-relative paths of the file.  Out-of-tree RDs
just cannot compute this.  Therefore, most subcommands that accept file
paths just refuse to work when the file in question is not below
inputsDir.


Not reloading services RD on server since no admin password available
=====================================================================

That's a warning you can get when you run ``gavo pub``.  The reason for
it is that the DaCHS server caches quite a bit of information (e.g., the
root page) that may depend on the table of published services (see also
`Managing Runtime Resources`_.  Therefore, ``gavo pub`` tries to make
the running server discard such caches.  To do this, it inspects the
``serverURL`` config item and tries access a protected resource.  Thus,
it needs the value of the config setting ``adminpasswd`` (if set), and
that needs to be identical on the machine gavo pub executes on and on
whatever serverURL points to.

If anything goes wrong, a warning is emitted.  The publication has
happened still, but you may need to run ``gavo serve reload`` on the
server to make it visible.

I'm getting "No output columns with these settings." instead of result rows
===========================================================================

This is particularly likely to happen with the scs.xml renderer.  There,
it can happen the the server doesn't even bother to run database queries
but instead keeps coming back with an error message ``No output columns
with these settings.``.

This happens when the "verbosity" (in SCS, this is computed as 10*VERB)
of the query is lower than the verbLevel of all the columns.  By
default, this verbLevel is 20.  In order to ensure that a column is
returned even with VERB=1, say::

  <column name=...  verbLevel="1"/>

gavo imp dies with Permission denied: u'/home/gavo/logs/dcErrors'
=================================================================

(or something similar).  The reason for these typically is that the user
that runs ``gavo imp`` is not in the ``gavo`` group (actually, whatever
[general]gavoGroup says).  To fix it, add that user.  If that user was,
say, fred, you'd say::

  sudo adduser fred gavo

Note that fred will either have to log in and out (or similar) or say
``newgrp gavo`` after that.


Warnings about popen, md5, etc being deprecated
===============================================

The python-nevow package that comes with Debian sequeeze is outdated.

I'm using reGrammar to parse a file, but no splitting takes place
=================================================================

This mostly happens for input lines like ``a|b|c``; the underlying
problem is that you're trying to split along regular expression
metacharacters.  The solution is to escape the the metacharacter.  In
the example, you wouldn't write::

  <reGrammar fieldSep="|"> <!-- doesn't work -->

but rather::

  <reGrammar fieldSep="\|"> <!-- doesn't work -->


IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "products_pkey"
==============================================================================

This happens when you try to import the same "product" twice.  There are
many possible reasons why this might happen, but the most common (of the
non-obvious ones) probably is the use of updating data items with row
triggers.

If you say something like::

    <!-- doesn't work reliably -->
    <table id="data" mixin="//products#table"
      ...
    <data id="import" updating="True">
      <sources>
        ...
        <ignoreSources fromdb="select accref from my.data"/>
      </sources>
      <fitsProdGrammar...
      <make table="data">
        <rowmaker>
           <ignoreOn name="Skip plates not yet in plate cat">
             <keyMissing key="DATE_OBS"/></ignoreOn>
      ...

you're doing it wrong.  The reason this yields IntegrityErrors is that
if the ignoreOn trigger fires, the row will not be inserted into the
table ``data``.  However, the make feeding the ``dc.products`` table
implicitely inserted by the ``//products#table`` mixin will not skip an
ignored image.  So, it will end up in ``dc.product``, but on the next
import, that source will be tried again – it didn't end up in my.data,
which is where ignoreSources takes its file names from –, and boom.

If you feed multiple tables in one data and you need to skip an input
row entirely, the only way to do that reliably is to trigger in the
grammar, like this::


    <table id="data" mixin="//products#table"
      ...
    <data id="import" updating="True">
      <sources>
        ...
        <ignoreSources fromdb="select accref from my.data"/>
      </sources>
      <fitsProdGrammar...
        <ignoreOn name="Skip plates not yet in plate cat">
           <keyMissing key="DATE_OBS"/></ignoreOn>
      </fitsProdGrammar>
      <make table="data">
      ...

gavo init/installation dies with UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec...
=====================================================================

The full signature is something like::

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyfits/core.py", line 103, in formatwarning
    return unicode(message) + '\n'
  UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2 in position 65: ordinal not in range(128)

This is a bug in pyfits, together with carelessness in passing through
error messages on our side.  We'll see which side will fix this first;
meanwhile, the easy workaround is to set ``lc_messages = 'C'`` in
``postgresql.conf`` (e.g., ``/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf``
on Debian wheezy).  That's probably a good idea anyway since TAP may
expose postgres error messages to the user, and these aren't nearly as
useful to remote users as to you if they're in your local language.


relation "dc.datalinkjobs" does not exist
=========================================

This happens when you try to run asynchronous datalink (the dlasync
renderer) when you've not created the datalink jobs table.  This is not
(yet) done automatically on installation since right now we consider
async datalink to be a bit of an exotic case.  To fix this, run::

  gavo imp //datalink


(some column) may be null but has no explicit null value
=========================================================

These are warnings emitted by the DaCHS' RD parser – since they are
warnings, you could ignore them, but you shouldn't.

This is about columns that have no "natural" NULL serialisation in
VOTables, mostly integers.  Without such a natural NULL, making VOTables
out of anything that comes out of these tables can fail under certain
circumstances.

There are (at least) two ways to fix this, depending on what's actually
going on:

(a) you're sure there are no NULLs in this column.  In that case, just
    add ``required="True"``, and the warnings will go away.  Note,
    however, that DaCHS will instruct the database to check that you're
    not cheating, and an import will fail if your try to put NULLs into
    such columns.

(b) there are NULLs in this column.  In that case, find a value that
    will work for NULL, i.e., one that is never used as an actual value.
    "Suspicious" values like 0, -1, -9999 or the like are preferred as
    this increases the chance that careless programs, formats, or users
    who ignore a NULL value specification have a chance to catch their
    error.  Then declare that null value like this::

      <column name="withNull" type="integer"...>
        <values nullLiteral="-9999"/>
      </column>


Column rave.main.logg_k: Unit dex is not interoperable
======================================================

The `VOUnit standard`_ lets you use essentially arbitrary strings as
units – so does DaCHS.  VOUnit, however, contains a canon of units VO
clients should understand.  If DaCHS understands units, you can, for
instance, change them on form input and output using the displayUnit
displayHint – other programs may allow automatic conversion and similar
comforts.

When DaCHS warns that a unit is not interoperable, this means your unit
will not be understood in that way.  There are cases when that's
justified, so it's just a warning, but be sure you understand what
you've written and there actually is no interoperable (i.e., using the
canonical VOUnits) way to express what you want to say.

Also not that it is an excellent idea to quote free (i.e.,
non-canonical) units, i.e., write ``unit='"Crab"'``.  The reason is that
in the non-quoted case, VOUnit parsers will try do separate off SI
prefixes, such that, e.g., ``dex`` will be interpreted as dezi-ex, i.e.,
a tenth of an ex (which happens to actually be a unit, incidentally,
although not a canonical VOUnit one).

And yes, dex itself would be a free unit.  If you look, quantities given
with "dex"" as a unit string actually are dimensionless.  Our
recommendation therefore is to have empty units for them.

.. _VOUnit standard: http://ivoa.net/documents/VOUnits/index.html


Column tab.foo is not a regular ADQL identifier
===============================================

This is a message you may see when running ``gavo val``.  It means that
the column in question has a name that will get you in trouble as soon
as you open the table in question to TAP queries (and trust me, you will
sooner or later).  Regular ADQL identifiers match the regular expression
``[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*`` with the additional restriction that ADQL
reserved  words (including terms like distance, size, etc) are not
allowed either.

If you see the message, just change the name in question.  There's so
many nice words that there's really no need to use funny characters in
identifiers  or hog ADQL reserved words.

If you *must* keep the name anyway, you can prefix it by ``q/`` to make
it a delimited identifier.  There's madness down that road, though, so
don't complain to us if you do that and regret it too late.
